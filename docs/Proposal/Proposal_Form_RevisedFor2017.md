**General area covered by project**

My proposal is a take-away delivery app, something like already exists e.g
JustEat. The app would be used by individuals and groups to order food and have
it delivered to their location, payment can also be handles within the app.

**Background**

The idea for the app stems from my use of JustEat and the lack of features to
cater for group, one person may order everything but they will also then have to
pay for everything and this can get messy when trying to figure out who owes
what.

**Achievements**

The app would be aimed primarily at students as they are most likely to be
ordering take-away food. The unique selling points of my app versus the
mainstream ones already popular would be the inclusion of group wallets and the
possibility of an Uber like real time tracking system that would allow a driver
to see your exact location and vice versa. The latter would be a useful feature
if you were abroad or if you are generally unfamiliar with the area.

**Justification**

This app would be an improvement upon existing similar apps and would allow
greater ease for both customers and the delivery drivers. Speeding up both the
ordering and delivery process by providing more detailed and accurate
information.

**Programming Languages**

The main app would be built for Android, I would also like to have a web
application which I would most likely be built using the MEAN stack i.e.
MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS & NodeJS

In terms of the location system, the Uber API should have the features needed to
implement this.
