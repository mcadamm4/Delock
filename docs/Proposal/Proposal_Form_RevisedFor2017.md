**General area covered by project**

My proposal is for a smart lock system based on the Ethereum platform. The
system would allow the renting and sharing of goods and services which were
traditionally very hard to monetise effectively. The main implementation would
be smart locks for equipment allowing people to rent personal effects to others
who pay a deposit and unlock the items via NFC or Bluetooth using their
smartphone.

**Background**

The idea for the app stems an article I read some time ago. A company was
working on implementing a blockchain based system to allow owners of autonomous
cars to send their cars out at night while they were sleeping to act as taxis
for others, basically earning a person money as they sleep. This is a phenomenal
idea so I wanted to apply it to other areas.

**Achievements**

The system would be open to anyone who wants to avail of a good or service for a
short term.

The system would allow owners to set a deposit for use of the product as well as
a cost price for hourly, daily or weekly use.

A user then comes along and pays this deposit. After payment, a transaction is
recorded and a block is added to the blockchain, the users is then free to open
and close the lock as often as they want before eventually returning the item.

When they return the item, another transaction is recorded and the users deposit
is returned to them minus the rental cost.

The owner then receives their payment from the user.

**Justification**

A Use Case very much applicable to Ireland due to the size of the farming
industry here would be the rental of farming equipment:

Farmers could avail of equipment owned by other farmers, this means small scale
farmers get access to high quality equipment and the owners find a way to
monetise equipment that only sees about one days use every year.

As well as this, co-ops and plant hire business that already own fleets of
equipment can switch to this system and allow farmers to use their equipment and
the system will manage itself.

This allows farmers to avoid buying very expensive equipment and for those who
do, they can earn money from said equipment and curb the cost of their
investment.

**Programming Languages**

C++ client running on a device such as an Arduino, Samsung Artik or Intel
Edison.

Ethereum blockchain platform.

**Learning Challenges**

Creating a blockchain.

Running clients on the locks that can communicate with each other.

**Hardware**

NFC or Bluetooth

Devices for locks i.e. one of the following Arduino, Samsung Artik or Intel
Edison.

Ethereum blockchain platform

**Proposal Guidelines**

**[Note: It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that the Supervisor
accepts your project and this is only recognised once the Supervisor assigns
herself/himself via the project dashboard. Project proposals without an assigned
Supervisor will not be accepted for presentation to the Approval Panel.]**
