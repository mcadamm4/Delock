**General area covered by project**

My proposal is a take-away delivery app. The app would incorporate real-time maps for customers and delivery drivers, group payment facilities and 
possibly a blockchain based payment system.

**Background**

The idea for the app stems from my use of the JustEat app and the lack of
features to cater for groups, one person may order everything but they will also
then have to pay for everything and this can get messy when trying to figure out
who owes what. 

**Achievements**

The app would be aimed primarily at students as they are most likely to be

ordering take-away food.

The unique selling points of my app versus the mainstream competition already
popular would be the inclusion of group wallets and the possibility of an Uber
like real time tracking system that would allow a driver to see your exact
location and vice versa.

The latter would be a useful feature if you were abroad or if you are generally
unfamiliar with the area.

A payment system based on blockchain would make the app more reliable, secure and
faster.

Other features include a matching system to allow strangers to get the best
value for their money by splitting meal deals with others. People would have to be 
within a certain radius of eachother to match up and possibly meet at an agreed location.

**Justification**

This app would be an improvement upon existing apps providing a similar service
and would allow greater ease of communication between customers and business.
Speeding up both the ordering and delivery process by providing more detailed
and accurate information in real-time. 
The blackchain payments would be more secure and faster than conventional methods and 
allow for a detailed and immutable record of transactions to be stored.
The ability to split meal deals would be a useful feature for college students living on a budget and having a dense
population of students nearby would make the meal deal splitting system
effective.

**Programming Languages**

CUustomers could interact with the system via an android app or a web app. The android app would be built using java.
The web app would use the MEAN stack and both interfaces can use the same back-end.

The MEAN stack includes MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS.

Business's would have a dedicated app or web app of their own showing orders and locations of their drivers etc.

In terms of the location system I believe the Uber API can provide this functionality. The blockchain system would
most likely use the Ethereum platform.
