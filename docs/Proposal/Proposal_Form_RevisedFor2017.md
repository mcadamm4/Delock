**General area covered by project**

<<<<<<< HEAD
My proposal is for a smart lock system based on the Ethereum platform. The
system would allow the renting and sharing of goods and services which were
traditionally very hard to monetise effectively. The main implementation would
be smart locks for equipment allowing people to rent personal effects to others
who pay a deposit and unlock the items via NFC or Bluetooth using their
smartphone.

**Background**

The idea for the app stems an article I read some time ago. A company was
working on implementing a blockchain based system to allow owners of autonomous
cars to send their cars out at night while they were sleeping to act as taxis
for others, basically earning a person money as they sleep. This is a phenomenal
idea so I wanted to apply it to other areas.
=======
My proposal is a take-away delivery app. The app would incorporate real-time maps for customers and delivery drivers, group payment facilities and 
possibly a blockchain based payment system.

**Background**

The idea for the app stems from my use of the JustEat app and the lack of
features to cater for groups, one person may order everything but they will also
then have to pay for everything and this can get messy when trying to figure out
who owes what.

**Achievements**

The system would be open to anyone who wants to avail of a good or service for a
short term.

The system would allow owners to set a deposit for use of the product as well as
a cost price for hourly, daily or weekly use.

A user then comes along and pays this deposit. After payment, a transaction is
recorded and a block is added to the blockchain, the users is then free to open
and close the lock as often as they want before eventually returning the item.

When they return the item, another transaction is recorded and the users deposit
is returned to them minus the rental cost.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The owner then receives their payment from the user.

**Justification**

A Use Case very much applicable to Ireland due to the size of the farming
industry here would be the rental of farming equipment:

Farmers could avail of equipment owned by other farmers, this means small scale
farmers get access to high quality equipment and the owners find a way to
monetise equipment that only sees about one days use every year.

As well as this, co-ops and plant hire business that already own fleets of
equipment can switch to this system and allow farmers to use their equipment and
the system will manage itself.

This allows farmers to avoid buying very expensive equipment and for those who
do, they can earn money from said equipment and curb the cost of their
investment.

**Programming Languages**

C++ client running on a device such as an Arduino, Samsung Artik or Intel
Edison.

Ethereum blockchain platform.

**Learning Challenges**

Creating a blockchain.

Running clients on the locks that can communicate with each other.

**Hardware**

NFC or Bluetooth

Devices for locks i.e. one of the following Arduino, Samsung Artik or Intel
Edison.

Ethereum blockchain platform
=======
A payment system based on blockchain would make the app more reliable, secure and
faster.

Other features include a matching system to allow strangers to get the best
value for their money by splitting meal deals with others. People would have to be 
within a certain radius of eachother to match up and possibly meet at an agreed location.

**Justification**

This app would be an improvement upon existing apps providing a similar service
and would allow greater ease of communication between customers and business.
Speeding up both the ordering and delivery process by providing more detailed
and accurate information in real-time. 
The blackchain payments would be more secure and faster than conventional methods and 
allow for a detailed and immutable record of transactions to be stored.
The ability to split meal deals would be a useful feature for college students living on a budget and having a dense
population of students nearby would make the meal deal splitting system
effective.

**Programming Languages**

CUustomers could interact with the system via an android app or a web app. The android app would be built using java.
The web app would use the MEAN stack and both interfaces can use the same back-end.

The MEAN stack includes MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS.

Business's would have a dedicated app or web app of their own showing orders and locations of their drivers etc.

In terms of the location system I believe the Uber API can provide this functionality. The blockchain system would
most likely use the Ethereum platform.
